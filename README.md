### Hi there, I'm Abi Adenaya! 👋

🛠️ I am currently working as a Cloud Operations Engineer with expertise in AWS, Terraform, CloudFormation, Docker, Kubernetes, Python, and more.

📧 You can reach me at: [abiadenaya@gmail.com]

🚀 I am passionate about solving problems, cloud computing, and continuous learning in the field. Beyond technology, I enjoy travel ✈️, photography 📷, music 🎵, culture 🌍, and reading 📖.

🌱 One of my proudest projects is my submission for the Cloud Resume Challenge, an initiative by Google's Forrest Brazeal. You can find my blog about it [here](link-to-your-blog) and the corresponding repositories [here](link-to-repo) and [here](another-link-to-repo).
